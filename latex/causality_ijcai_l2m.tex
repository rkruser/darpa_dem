\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In a given learning environment, some variables are causal, and some are merely correlated with the prediction targets. Standard machine learning models make no distinction between the two, making the models less robust to domain shift, in which causal factors remain invariant but correlations change. Given background knowledge about the causal structure of the environment, we demonstrate a simple adversarial method to train a predictor that ignores non-causal information. We show results on two artificial environments.
